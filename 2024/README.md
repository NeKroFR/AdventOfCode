# Advent of Code 2024

This year I've decided to code in c++ because c++ is cool. ðŸ˜ƒ

I may have cheated sometimes and used python, but the majority of my solutions are written in c++.


## Setup

To set up the problems for the day, I just use my [fetch.sh](https://github.com/NeKroFR/AdventOfCode/blob/main/2024/fetch.sh) script and provide it the day number.

You need to put your session cookie in the .env file to be able to fetch the input.
