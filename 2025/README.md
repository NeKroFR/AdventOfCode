# Advent of Code 2025

This year I wanted to challenge myself, so I've decided to try to solve every problem in system verilog (and to write optimized code 💀). 

## Setup

To set up the problems for the day, I just use my [fetch.sh](https://github.com/NeKroFR/AdventOfCode/blob/main/2025/fetch.sh) script and provide it the day number.

You need to put your session cookie in the .env file to be able to fetch the input.
